## Instructions
Since scikit-multiflow is no longer supported, it doesn't work with the modern Python version, and many modern libraries.
These are the versions I used. I would recommend doing the same:

Python version: 3.8 (latest python version at the date of scikit-multiflow's last update) 
pip install numpy==1.19.5
pip install pandas==1.0.0
pip install matplotlib==3.4.0
pip install scikit-multiflow

Google Colab uses a much newer Python version so I unfortunately could not get it to work on Colab. Use a local Python 3.8 installation.

If you only want to check the results without running the .ipynb notebook, you can do so from the RESULTS directory.
